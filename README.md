# Sparkling Christmas Tree 🎄

A festive animated Christmas tree using Python's turtle graphics library with sparkling ornaments, twinkling star, and dynamic lighting effects.

## Features

- Three-layered Christmas tree with realistic colors
- Animated ornaments that change colors
- Twinkling gold star on top
- Random sparkle effects throughout the tree
- Midnight blue winter night background

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- turtle (included in standard library)

## Usage

```bash
python christmas_tree.py
```

Click anywhere on the window to exit the animation.

## How It Works

The animation uses multiple turtle objects to create different elements:

- Static tree structure and trunk
- Dynamic ornament objects that cycle through color palettes
- Sparkle effects that appear randomly across the tree
- Star that alternates between gold, yellow, and orange

The animation loop updates every 500ms to create smooth, festive sparkles.
